# Introduction

Welcome to the Discord Bot Program GitHub page. This program was made to simplify how you interact with bots. This program allows you to do the following:

- **Send messages** (Normal, TTS).
- **Send Embeds** (With custom colors or the pre-built colors).
- **Change the status of the bot** (Playing, Watching, Streaming, etc).
- **Change the presence of the bot** (Online, AFK, DND etc).



## How to use

This program logins to your bot through **it's token**. If you know how to copy the token then skip on ahead, if not then follow the steps below.

1. **Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).**

2. **Click on "New Application", provide the name and click "Create"** (If you already have a bot, go to step 4).

3. After adding what you want to send to the channel, click on "Add field" to add a field to the Embed. You can add up to 25 fields and can have up to 2048 characters in an Embeds's description.

   Optionally, you can specify a color for the Embed, you can either choose a built-in color, or use a HEX color code. If you want to use one of the built-in colors, you can change it from a "Color code" to one of the colors available. If you want to use a color code then use one of the HEX/HTML color pickers online. ([This is an example](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)). Do keep in mind that you will have to add a `0x` before the color code for it to work.
